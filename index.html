            <div class="funfacts">
            <p>Yogurt has been around for a while, but frozen yogurt is actually pretty new. Since freezers haven’t been around for as long, it wasn’t possible to make frozen yogurt until the 1900s, when freezers were invented. Even still, the first commercial frozen yogurt wasn’t available until the early 1970s. A few decades later, you can find frozen yogurt in markets and specialty frozen yogurt shops across the globe because of the high demand for this delicious treat!</p>
            <p>Back when Fro-yo was first invented and sold, it was sold only in scoops like ice cream. When soft-serve frozen yogurt was first invented in the 1980s, it quickly became popular, and stores have been serving it like that ever since!</p>
            <p>Your beloved frozen yogurt contains bacteria, but don’t worry – it’s the good kind! Fro-yo is made by adding these good bacteria to milk and ferment, producing a lot of its unique qualities. After fermentation, lactose is turned into lactic acid, explaining the tart flavor in classic fro-yo, like our Eurotart flavor. These probiotics in fro-yo is actually really good for your digestive health. It has been shown to lower cholesterol and boost your immune system. </p>
